
1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?

   cat signif.txt.tsv | tail -n +2 | wc -l
   
   5958


2. How many columns are in the table?

   head -n1 signif.txt.tsv | wc -w

   47

3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

   cat signif.txt.tsv | cut -f '3,10,18' > Year_Mag_Country.tsv



4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.
   
   sort -k2 -rn Year_Mag_Country.tsv | head -n 10
	
	1960     9.5    CHILE
	1964     9.2    USA
	2011     9.1    JAPAN
	2004     9.1    INDONESIA
	1952     9.0    RUSSIA
	1700     9.0    USA
	2010     8.8    CHILE
	1812     8.8    USA
	1716     8.8    PERU
	1965     8.7    USA



5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.
   
   cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f '3' | sort | uniq | tail -n +2 | wc -l

   153	


6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

   cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | grep 'USA'

   39 USA TERRITORY
   255 USA


7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.

   cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | grep 'USA' | grep -v 'USA TERRITORY'

   255 USA
	


8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

   cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c -f2 | sort -nr | head -n 10

    3171 CHILE
    790 TUNISIA
    578 PERU
    271 MONGOLIA
    261 SOUTH KOREA
    253 KIRIBATI
    168 AFGHANISTAN
    151 ARGENTINA
    100 SIERRA LEONE
    89 PAPUA NEW GUINEA



9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.

	 ./countEq.sh
   	
        Country = CHINA
        579 CHINA


	read -p " Country = "  Coun1
	cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep "$Coun1"
        

10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.

           ./countEq_getLargestEq.sh
        
        read -p " Country = "  Coun1
	cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep "$Coun1"
        sort -nrk2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep "$Coun1" | head -1 | cut -f2


	Country = CHINA
  	 579 CHINA
	 8.5


11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.


     cut -f1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head -n 10

     78 2004
     77 2008
     72 2003
     67 2007
     62 2010
     61 2006
     60 2009
     60 2005
     60 2002
     59 2011


12. Create a shell script that loops over the top ten years with the most earthquakes (from exercise 11), finds all the earthquakes for a given year and writes them to file named $YEAR-earthquakes.txt, where $YEAR is the for loop variable assigned from the top ten list. Your code should output ten different files (one for each year in the top ten list). Hints: Take your answer from exercise 11 and extract the year column, then use this for the range in a for loop by inserting them like this for YEAR in $(insert code that lists top ten years here). The rest is just a grep and a redirect > to a file with the correct name.


	for YEAR in $(echo $(cut -f1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort |  uniq -c | sort -nr | head ) | cut -d ' ' -f '2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20')
        do
        grep $YEAR Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l >> $YEAR-earthquakes.txt
        done
